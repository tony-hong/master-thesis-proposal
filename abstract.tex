We introduce a neural network model capturing both lexical and semantic features of event participants. Several possible methods to composite word and semantic role representations are explored. Making use of tensor factorisation on role-specific word embedding (Tilk et al. 2016), we represent the order-3 tensor feature space using 3 matrices. Then we add non-linearity and construct the model as a neural network. The model is trained in multitask style to counter both semantic role-filler prediction and semantic role-label prediction tasks. Comparing to previous works, the model has improvement on both semantic role/role-filler modelling and human thematic fit judgement correlations task. Moreover, the trained model has high accuracy on semantic role prediction.
